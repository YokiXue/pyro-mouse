**Pyro-mouse**

“Pyro-Mouse” is a first-person action-adventure game that puts the player in control of a mouse named Jerry, who has just escaped from an evil science lab. The lab was conducting experiments to replace all organic mice in the world with mechanical ones. However, Jerry managed to escape and is now on a mission to both save his fellow mice from this fate and destroy this evil lab at any cost.

As the player, you will navigate your way through the lab environment and tackle four different tasks/challenges by figuring out how to achieve the different goals laid out to the player through narratives in order to win the game. Some of these different tasks and challenges involve pushing in the right sequence of numbers to trigger something to happen, or pushing different objects that can be found within the environment to collide with another object to make something else happen. The main setting of this game will be taking place within the lab itself.

By assuming the role of Jerry, players gain a firsthand understanding of the desire for freedom and the determination to break free from oppressive forces. It invites players to reflect on the broader implications of oppression and the importance of standing up against it.

Unlike other games in the same category, “Pyro-Mouse” offers a unique blend of immersive storytelling, dynamic challenges, engaging gameplay mechanics, and a distinct visual style. While many action-adventure games focus solely on combat and exploration, “Pyro-Mouse” offers a refreshing twist by incorporating puzzle-solving elements into the gameplay. Players will need to think strategically, solve puzzles, and use their problem-solving skills to progress through the game.
